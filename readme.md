# HUE

[Play Hue!](https://hue-puzzle.surge.sh)

This mobile-friendly puzzle game allows a user to select 4 colors, one for each corner of the grid.
Once the corners have their assigned colors, the remainder of the grid is generated using these
colors and the grid is shuffled (all except for the corners).  Re-arrange the tiles to form the original grid to win!

Don't like the colors you chose?  Change them at any time and re-generate a new grid!

The 'Show Progress' button toggles a progress bar above the grid that shows the current % of tiles
in the correct position.

Selecting colors closer together on the color wheel will increase difficulty.
