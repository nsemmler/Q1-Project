# Hue
#### The colored tile puzzle game.
https://hue-puzzle.surge.sh

I (Love) Hue is a puzzle game I have been playing for months on my phone.  The game works a bit like this:

You are shown a grid of tiles that are then shuffled around.  The goal is to re-arrange the tiles in the original order.  What makes this so tricky is
the fact that the grid has a smooth gradient between the colors in the 4 corners.  Combine this with the fact that the tiles themselves don't have borders and the tile colors seemingly change color when adjacent to the right tile.

My only issue with the original app is that it doesn't allow the user any customization.  Therefore, I decided to build my own app to allow a user to create their own grids to solve.

## User Stories
- I want to select my own colors for the grid.  
- I want to be able to track my progress as I go along.  
- I want to be able to play this on my phone.
- I want to be able to toggle between the solution and my current puzzle.  
- I want to swap the place of two tiles.  
- I want to move seamlessly from the color input to the puzzle.
